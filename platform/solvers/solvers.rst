Solvers availability
====================

AIMMS, as a complete optimization modeling system, comes with all
functionality to develop and create complete optimization applications.
This means that a large set of mathematical model types (Linear, Mixed
Integer, Nonlinear, Mixed Integer Nonlinear, etc.) can be formulated
within AIMMS. AIMMS uses solvers to optimize mathematical models.
Depending on the solvers available with your license, you are able to
solve the models at a requested performance (high and medium performance
solvers do exist for most model types).

The standard license of AIMMS includes the world-class solver
CPLEX.
The installation package of AIMMS also has
the `COIN-OR <http://www.coin-or.org/>`__ solvers CBC (LP/MIP) and IPOPT
(NLP) included; these two solvers are not owned or serviced by the AIMMS
company – they are by the open source community – but can be also used
by any AIMMS user. This set of solvers, together with the freely
available :doc:`advanced-algorithms`
set of AIMMS such as AIMMS Outer Approximation, Benders Decomposition
and more – offers a great start for creating optimization applications.
Of course, the set of solvers available in a license can be extended by
other `commercial solver
add-ons <https://www.aimms.com/support/licensing>`__.

All solvers are connected to AIMMS by using the :doc:`AIMMS Open Solver
Interface <open-solver-interface>`,
which link solvers through a collection of C++ interfaces.

.. [*] Because the AIMMS Cloud is a serviced platform we did not include all solvers that are available in an AIMMS Developer setup. At this moment, we added the most common solvers used in production setups and have a minimal requirement that a solver support team is available to handle issues that might arise (hence Open Source solvers are not part of the AIMMS Cloud setup). If you have any requests, please contact us via support@aimms.com.

.. _robust-optimization-add-on:

Robust Optimization Add-on
--------------------------

AIMMS offers a commercial Robust Optimization Add-on (RO) to incorporate
uncertainty (e.g. development of the energy price) into your model.
AIMMS RO considers data uncertainties against whose realizations the
solution is required to remain feasible. This uncertainty may occur in
any part of the model data. Partial feasibility can be included by
adding probabilities to constraints (e.g. the chance that demand is met
is at least 95%). 

You can add this add-on upon purchase of your AIMMS licenses, or add it
later; please be advised that the RO Add-on recommends an AIMMS license
that also contains the CPLEX Solver.

Note: This Robust Optimization add-on was built in co-operation with
professor Aharon Ben-Tal and the Technion Institute.

.. _supported-math-program-types:

Supported Math Program Types
----------------------------

If you would like to extend the power of AIMMS (beyond the open source
COIN-OR solvers and AOA algorithm) with commercial solvers, we offer you
the possibility to add commercial solvers to AIMMS. If you already have
a license for one of the available additional solvers (in the form of a
callable library), you can also request a *Solver Link* and use your
existing solver license with AIMMS.
