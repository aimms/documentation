BARON Solver for Global Optimization
-------------------------------------
The BARON solver (Branch-And-Reduce Optimization Navigator) is a global optimization (GO) solver: it is a computational system for solving nonconvex optimization problems to global optimality. Purely continuous, purely integer, and mixed-integer nonlinear problems can be solved with the software.

The Branch And Reduce Optimization Navigator derives its name from its combining constraint propagation, interval analysis, and duality in its reduce arsenal with enhanced branch and bound concepts as it winds its way through the hills and valleys of complex optimization problems in search of global solutions.

BARON can be used to find the k-best solutions. BARON can also handle mixed integer programming problems.

BARON Usage
-----------
BARON guarantees to provide global optima under fairly general assumptions, but cannot handle constraints that contain goniometric functions or with a reference to an external function. BARON requires that all nonlinear variables and expressions in the mathematical program are bounded from below and above.
