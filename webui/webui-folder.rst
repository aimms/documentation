WebUI Folder
************

An AIMMS WebUI-ready application is an AIMMS application with a Web User Interface built on top of it. In particular, this means that the application directory contains a *WebUI* subfolder in the *MainProject* folder (this folder is created automatically when `starting WebUI <publishing.html>`_ for the first time).
