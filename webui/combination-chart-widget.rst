Combination Chart Widget
========================

The Combination Chart widget is an example of a widget based on the so-called highcharts offered by https://www.highcharts.com/ and further supported in the AIMMS WebUI.

The Combination Chart widget can combine several chart types in a single chart widget. More specifically, it has been built upon the combination chart presented at https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/combining-chart-types.

Currently, The Combination Chart widget only supports the 'column' chart type, resulting in a Column Chart, see also https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/column-chart. 
In the near future, the Combination Chart widget in AIMMS WebUI will be extended with other chart types like ‘line’ and ‘area’ and you will be able to specify a chart type per identifier. 

For the time being, please refer to the supported features described in the section below:
