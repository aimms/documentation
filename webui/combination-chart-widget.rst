Combination Chart Widget
========================

The Combination Chart widget is an example of a widget based on the so-called highcharts offered by https://www.highcharts.com/ and further supported in the AIMMS WebUI.

The Combination Chart widget can combine the features of several highcharts in a single chart. More specifically, it is based on the combination chart presented at https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/combining-chart-types.

Currently, AIMMS WebUI supports only the usage of a set of column series, also referred to as a Column Chart, see also https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/column-chart. 
In the future, the Combination Chart widget in AIMMS WebUI will be extended in order to support more chart types simultaneously. 

For the time being, please refer to the supported features described in the section about the `Column Chart <column-chart-widget.html#>`__.
