Data Coloring and Palettes
============

WebUI comes with some palettes that can be used to color the data in your widgets. For this, most elements of Chart widgets automatically receive the correct annotations to allow each of them to show up in a specific color.

.. note::
     Please note that in AIMMS versions prior to 4.69 the default palette had a length of 19 colors, not 16. Also, the palette was more of a smooth gradient, aimed at making charts pretty, but also making it harder to tell the difference between adjacent items.

     If you insist on (still) having the older palettes of 19, 11 or 7 colors, or if you please refer to the section about Custom Palettes
