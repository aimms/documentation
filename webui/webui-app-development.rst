This main section contains a number of sub-sections dedicated to various topics related to the WebUI app development.

Some matters which are applicable to several sub-sections are mentioned here directly. 

For example, starting from AIMMS 4.96, WebUi supports calling procedures with optional arguments in several places, such as behind a button widget, as part of item, widget, or page actions, as well as for page load and page leave procedures.
When a procedure with optional arguments is used in one of these places, the call will be made based on the default values of the optional arguments.

The description of the specific tools for WebUI app development and related topics can be accessed using the following navigation scheme:
