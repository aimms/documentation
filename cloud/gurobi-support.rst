Gurobi Support on AIMMS Cloud Platform
======================================

Running Gurobi on the AIMMS Cloud Platform requires the `Gurobi Web License Service <https://www.gurobi.com/web-license-service/>`__ offered by Gurobi Optimization which is a Gurobi licensing service for containers running on Docker (among others).  Also, you need to acquire a (paid) Gurobi-link extension for your AIMMS Cloud; please contact us at info@aimms.com if you are interested.

.. note::

	To use Gurobi on the AIMMS Cloud Platform you will need **AIMMS version 4.81** (or higher) and **Gurobi version 9.1** (or higher).

To run Gurobi on the AIMMS Cloud Platform you first have to access the `Gurobi Web License Manager <https://license.gurobi.com/manager/doc/overview/>`__ (requires login to your Gurobi account) and download your Gurobi client license file, called ``gurobi.lic``. This license file contains connection parameters which are used by Gurobi to connect to the WLS server and retrieve a token.

Next this information has to be made available in your AIMMS project, for which two approaches are available.

	* First, you can directly use the license file ``gurobi.lic`` by copying it to the root directory of your AIMMS project, i.e., the directory containing the ``.aimms`` file. You then have to include this license file in the ``.aimmspack`` file which will be created if you export an end-user project. This approach can be practical for testing.


	* Second, you can specify the required connection parameters WLSACCESSID, WLSSECRET and LICENSEID using the functions :any:`GMP::Solver::SetEnvironmentStringParameter` and :any:`GMP::Solver::SetEnvironmentIntegerParameter`. The values of these parameters can be retrieved from the license file ``gurobi.lic``. 


An example
----------

.. code-block:: aimms

	if pro::DelegateToServer then
    	return 1;
	endif;

	MIPSolver := CurrentSolver('MIP');

	GMP::Solver::SetEnvironmentStringParameter( MIPSolver, "WLSACCESSID", "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" );
	GMP::Solver::SetEnvironmentStringParameter( MIPSolver, "WLSSECRET", "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" );
	GMP::Solver::SetEnvironmentIntegerParameter( MIPSolver, "LICENSEID", xxxxxx );

	solve MP;


Optionally you can set the following parameter to print more license related information:

.. code-block:: aimms

	GMP::Solver::SetEnvironmentIntegerParameter( MIPSolver, "CSClientLog", 3 );


The second approach is recommended for production applications.
