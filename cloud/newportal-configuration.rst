Tunnels
-------

AIMMS PRO allows the AIMMS PRO Client to connect to the AIMMS license server and the AIMMS PRO backend via a websockets proxy running on the web port of PRO (the only port that needs to be opened in case PRO is running behind a firewall, by default 8080). By using the PRO Configurator to enable the tunneling functionality, any port and host reachable by PRO (but not by the client) can be made available via the websockets proxy.
