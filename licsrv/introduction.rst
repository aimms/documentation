    The AIMMS modeling software comes with built-in capabilities to acquire its license from a floating network license server. Before you can make use of this facility, an AIMMS Network License Server must be installed on a server PC somewhere on your local area network. This chapter discusses the installation and basic setup of the AIMMS Network License Server, as well as the setup of client AIMMS installations. In a number of situations, using a floating network license server to obtain an AIMMS license may be more convenient than using a single-user license. The latter always requires that the computer be protected by a nodelocked AIMMS license. Using a network license server could be convenient, for instance, in the following situations:

    *  if, at any time, only a small part of a (potentially) large group of users needs to make use of AIMMS concurrently, or 
    *  if you do not want to distribute single-user AIMMS licenses among your users. 

    Acquiring a license from a network license server is typically not a good idea for AIMMS users who are running AIMMS on their notebook computer and travel a substantial part of their time.
