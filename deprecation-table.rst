AIMMS Product Lifecycle
===========================

Deprecated and End of Life
------------------------------

AIMMS considers a feature  **Deprecated** if we plan to remove it; potentially it can be replaced by something different, but not necessarily! 
We announce deprecated features so developers can prepare for it and start looking for other ways (in- or outside our product) of achieving 
the desired behavior without using that feature because it might not be available in future versions. 
When possible, we add an **End of Life** to the feature as well; this is the date that the future is no longer available to the users.

* Where possible, we provide alternatives
* Support on Deprecated features is very limited, in most cases none 


**Example:** The Compound Sets were deprecated in Jan 2018. They have been completed removed as of 4.73 (May 2020). We developed 
a `How-to <https://how-to.aimms.com/Articles/109/109-deprecate-compound-sets-overview.html>`__ that guides AIMMS developers to an 
adjustment of their models in case they use Compound Sets (by proposing another concept to keep the model running as it should).
