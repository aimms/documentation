HTTP Client Library
*******************

.. note:: Since AIMMS 24, the HTTP Client Library is no longer supported.  See also `AIMMS Product Lifecycle <https://documentation.aimms.com/deprecation-table.html>`_


The HTTP Client library provides a basic API through which HTTP requests can be created and executed from within your model.

.. note::

   The HTTP Client library is provided as-is. Although we will try to answer to requests if these are easily implemented, this library 
   is not part of the regular AIMMS roadmap, nor does it fall under the AIMMS SLS.
