Email Client Library
********************

.. note:: Since AIMMS 24, the Email Client Library is no longer supported.  See also `AIMMS Product Lifecycle <https://documentation.aimms.com/deprecation-table.html>`_


The Email Client library provides a basic API through which emails can be created and sent from within your model.

.. note::

   The Email Client library is provided as-is. Although we will try to answer to requests if these are easily implemented, this library 
   is not part of the regular AIMMS roadmap, nor does it fall under the AIMMS SLS.
