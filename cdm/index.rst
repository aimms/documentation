AIMMS Collaborative Data Management (CDM) provides the capability to turn any AIMMS project into a *multi-user scenario planning application*. It does so by backing the AIMMS app by a *versioned* application database managed by the AIMMS CDM component, which is able to capture any collection of data changes made by a user throughout the app into a single tractable transaction.
